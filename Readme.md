ELibrary Smart Contract
Vision
The ELibrary project aims to create a decentralized library management system that empowers users to manage and borrow books securely and transparently. By leveraging blockchain technology, we ensure the integrity and availability of book records while facilitating an easy borrowing process for users.

Features
Book Management:

Users can add new books to the library with titles and available copies.
Borrowing System:

Users can borrow books if copies are available, ensuring fair access to library resources.
Decentralization:

The library operates on a blockchain, providing transparent and tamper-proof records of books and transactions.
Ownership Tracking:

Each book is associated with its owner, enabling accountability and clarity in borrowing transactions.
